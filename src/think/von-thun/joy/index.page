   # 4. Mailing group "concatenative"
   
   There is also a discussion group dealing with Joy and related topics. To browse previous messages, or to join the group, see [ http://groups.yahoo.com/group/concatenative][80]  
Both browsing and joining are junk-mail-proof. These messages can be read without joining the group. There have been 1116 contributions in the first two years, 1-MAY-2000 to 1-MAY-2002. Thanks to the coordinator, Billy Tanksley, for setting it up. I am also very grateful to the members of this group for many discussions, ideas and help. 

   [80]: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/concatenative
   
   In addition to the mail messages there is also a growing collection of files:  
[ http://groups.yahoo.com/group/concatenative/files/][81]  
These files have been contributed by members of the mailing group. They contain several Joy programs, some discussion papers, some documentation, and also an implementation (NJoy) of Joy in ML. These files can only be read after joining the group.
