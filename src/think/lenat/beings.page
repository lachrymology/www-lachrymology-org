Abstract 
========

Knowledge may be organized as a community of interacting modules Each module is granted a complex structure, to simulate a particular expert in some small domain An extended analogy is drawn to a group of cooperating human specialists. Based on this, an internal constraint is imposed on the modules. Then structure must be standard over the entire community. Some advantages of a uniform formalism are thereby preserved. An experimental community was implemented for the task domain of automatic programming. It has managed to synthesize a few inductive inference LISP programs, nonformally, from specific restricted dialogues with a human user
