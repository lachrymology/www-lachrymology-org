Abstract 
========

Knowledge may be organized as a community of interacting modules Each module is granted a complex structure, to simulate a particular expert in some small domain An extended analogy is drawn to a group of cooperating human specialists. Based on this, an internal constraint is imposed on the modules. Then structure must be standard over the entire community. Some advantages of a uniform formalism are thereby preserved. An experimental community was implemented for the task domain of automatic programming. It has managed to synthesize a few inductive inference LISP programs, nonformally, from specific restricted dialogues with a human user.

Experts and Beings
==================

Consider an interdisciplinary enterprise, attempted by a community of human expeits who are specialists in - and only in .. then own fields What modes of interactions will be productive? The dominant paradigm might well settle into questioning and an sinning each other Instead of a chairman, suppose the group adopts rules for gaining the floor, what a speaker may do, and how to resolve disputes When a topic is being considered, one or two experts might recognize it and speak up In the course of their exposition they might need to call on other specialists This might be by name, by specialty, or simply by posing a new sub-question and hoping someone rould recognize Ins own relevance and volunteer a suggestion Such tiansfers would be more common at the beginning, when the task is (by assumption) too geneial for any one member to compiehend As the questions form on more specific issues, single individuals should be able to supply complete solutions If the task is to construct something, (hen the activities of the experts should not be strictly verbal. Olten. one will recognize his relevance to the current situation and ask to tto something, clarify or modify or (raiely) create.
